## Hello I'm Charlotte ðŸŒ·

I am currently finishing my A-Levels in Maths, Further maths, Physics and Computer science and am planning to study Maths with Physics at university. I enjoy coding and have completed many projects, both for college and for fun. One of my favourites was completing the BPhO computational physics challenge, in which I had to code a series of projectile motion including animations and different scenarios, in which I achieved a gold award for my work. I also enjoy working in a team and at college have worked on a few group projects, including creating an animal version of the game monopoly.
